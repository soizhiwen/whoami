    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>
      Synthetic time series generated by diffusion models enable sharing
      privacy-sensitive datasets, such as patients' functional MRI records. Key
      criteria for synthetic data include high data utility and traceability to
      verify the data source. Recent watermarking methods embed in homogeneous
      latent spaces, but state-of-the-art time series generators operate in real
      space—making latent-based watermarking incompatible. This creates the
      challenge of watermarking directly in real space while handling feature
      heterogeneity and temporal dependencies. We propose TimeWak, the first
      watermarking algorithm for multivariate time series diffusion models. To
      handle temporal dependence and spatial heterogeneity, TimeWak embeds a
      temporal chained-hashing watermark directly within the real
      temporal-feature space. The other unique feature is the ϵ-exact inversion,
      which addresses the non-uniform reconstruction error distribution across
      features from inverting the diffusion process to detect watermarks. We
      derive the error bound of inverting multivariate time series and further
      maintain high watermark detectability. We extensively evaluate TimeWak on
      its impact on synthetic data quality, watermark detectability, and
      robustness under various post-editing attacks, against 5 datasets and
      baselines of different temporal lengths. Our results show that TimeWak
      achieves improvements of 61.96% in context-FID score, and 8.44% in
      correlational scores against the strongest state-of-the-art baseline,
      while remaining consistently detectable.
