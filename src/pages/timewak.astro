      <p>
        Synthetic time series generated by diffusion models enable sharing
        privacy-sensitive datasets, such as patients' functional MRI records.
        Key criteria for synthetic data include high data utility and
        traceability to verify the data source. Recent watermarking methods
        embed in homogeneous latent spaces, but state-of-the-art time series
        generators operate in real space, making latent-based watermarking
        incompatible. This creates the challenge of watermarking directly in
        real space while handling feature heterogeneity and temporal
        dependencies. We propose TimeWak, the first watermarking algorithm for
        multivariate time series diffusion models. To handle temporal dependence
        and spatial heterogeneity, TimeWak embeds a temporal chained-hashing
        watermark directly within the real temporal-feature space. The other
        unique feature is the ϵ-exact inversion, which addresses the non-uniform
        reconstruction error distribution across features from inverting the
        diffusion process to detect watermarks. We derive the error bound of
        inverting multivariate time series, while preserving robust watermark
        detectability. We extensively evaluate TimeWak on its impact on
        synthetic data quality, watermark detectability, and robustness under
        various post-editing attacks, against five datasets and baselines of
        different temporal lengths. Our results show that TimeWak achieves
        improvements of 61.96% in context-FID score, and 8.44% in correlational
        scores against the strongest state-of-the-art baseline, while remaining
        consistently detectable.
